This file will go through the steps and the Rcode necessary for creating a Table One from data in the file "hw1data.csv" using an existing package.


First, read the data into R. 

```{r}
hw1data = read.csv("hw1data.csv")
```


Now, display the first few rows of the data to look at what we have. 

```{r}
head(hw1data)
```
